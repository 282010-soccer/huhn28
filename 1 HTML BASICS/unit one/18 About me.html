        <h1 style="background-color: fuchsia;"><em>About Ryan Huhn</h1></em>
 
       Hello, my name is Ryan Huhn and I am 14 years old. To start I am an athlete,
I play soccer for the soccer club known as Plymouth Reign. I am a freshman at Divine Child
High school. I am in three Honors classes and I take school very seriously.
I have one sister her name is Camryn but people call her Cami. My favorite holiday is Christmas 
 and my favorite food is my Grandmas homade spagetti. My dream collage is Notre Dame because my dads side of the family loves 
 Notre Dame and I have grown up rooting for them. I would love to play soccer in college even if it is just for 
 the club team. My second dream collage would be Michigan in Ann Arbor because that is where my mom went and i 
 want to be a part of a sorority especially Sigma Kapa.
