<h1>Zac Brown Band</h1>
<hr><p>This is my favorite band because they sing country which is my favorite style 
    of music and their songs have a good beat.</p> 
My favorite person in the bad is Zac Brown he is the lead singer and I like his voice.

    <br> <p>One of my favorite songs is called the Island song it reminds me of being on a boat in the 
    summer time.</p>
