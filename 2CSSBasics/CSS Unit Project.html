  <p>I have a lot of hobbys but my all time favorite one is to bake and that is what this project
    is on. I love to bake desserts for my family. I have a big sweet tooth so I love to eat
    yummy deserts. I recently got a Ninja Creami for Christmas which is a ice cream maker and
    it lets you make ice cream, milkshakes, sorbet, and gelato.I have already made protien chocaloate
    icecream and pinapple dole whip. My love for baking sprung up when i went over to my neighbors house.
    my family is very good friends with our neighbors so during covid when i couldnt go to school my neighbors
    would invite my sister and i over to have lunch with her(she is a very good cook).
    All of her meals were homeade and delicous. I remember she would make the best grilled
    cheese.then once it was my birthday she baked me this delicous coffee cake,i asked her for the recipe
    and I made it for myself. Thats how it all started.

  <h1> What I Have Baked so Far!</h1>
  <p>For Christmas this year I got a Ninja Creami ice cream maker. This machine lets you make
    homeade protien ice cream. So far i have made lots of different ice cream: cookies and cream,
    pinapple dole whip, chocalate, and black cherry. All of the ice creams that i have made so far have
    been so good. I know that it technically isn't baking but i think that it is. I also have baked
    muffins berfore like bluberry muffins and they are so good especially for breakfast. the thing that
    I most love to bake are brownies. they are easy to bake and mostly everyone likes to eat them.
