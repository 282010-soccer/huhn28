     <p>I have a lot of hobbys but my all time favorite on is to bake and that is what this project 
        is on. I love to bake desserts for my family. I have a big sweet tooth so I love to eat
         yummy deserts. I recently got a Ninja Creami for Christmas which is a ice cream maker and
         it lets you make ice cream, milkshakes, sorbet, and gelato.I have already made protien chocaloate 
         icecream and pinapple dole whip. My love for baking sprung up when i went over to my neighbors house.
         my family is very good friends with our neighbors so during covid when i couldnt go to school my neighbors
         would invite my sister and i over to have lunch with her(she is a very good cook).
          All of her meals were homeade and delicous. I remember she would make the best grilled
           cheese. then once it was my birthday she baked me this delicous coffee cake,i asked her for the recipe
         and I made it for myself. Thats how it all started.
