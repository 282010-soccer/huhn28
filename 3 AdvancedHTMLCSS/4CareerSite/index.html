          <p>As an interior designer you will help clients pick out 
            peices of furniture, and decorations for your clients house 
            according to their wants and needs. Interior designers help to make indoor spaces functional
            and safe for clients needs. If a person in a wheelchair needs help to 
            redesign her bathroom we might put a bench seat in her shower and give our client enough space in the bathroom
            to fit her wheelchair. We determine space requirements so we won't put a king bed in a bedroom,that
            can only fit a twin bed. We select essential and decorative items to make the clients house feel like a home.
            As and interior designer you have to follow what your client asks of you, you wouldn't put yellow curtains
             in their family room when they specifically asked for white curtains. you would instead bring
             the idea up to them and ask if they like the idea or want to stick with theirs.
