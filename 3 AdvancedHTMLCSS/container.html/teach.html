                <h2>Container Tag</h2>
                <h3>In CSS, a container is a structural element used to
                    group and organize content on a webpage. It typically
                    serves as a parent element that holds other elements
                    (like text, images, or other HTML components) and helps
                    control their layout, alignment, and spacing.</h3>

        <tr>
            <td>
                <h2>Container Fluid</h2>
                <h3> In CSS, container-fluid creates a container that spans the entire width of the viewport,
                    adjusting to different screen sizes without margins or gutters.
                    It's ideal for full-width elements like headers, footers, or hero
                    sections, providing a seamless transition across devices. With no
                    predefined maximum width or centering, it's perfect for full-bleed
                    layouts where content should extend from edge to edge without any constraints.</h3>

            <td><h2>What is the difference between Container and Container-fluid</h2> 
            <h3>Both of these are class tags that provide something when used like class="container" class="container-fliud". 
                The difference in these two class tags is that they provide different things when used in code. 
            The class .container tag provides a responsive fixed width container.
        The class .container-fluid tag provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.</h3>
    
    
    <h2> The biggest difference between the class container and the class container fluid is that container provides
         a fixed width container while container-fluid provies a full width container</h2></td>
