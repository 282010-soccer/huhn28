    <p><h3> what is candy? Well candy is a very sugary treat that kids love to eat. There are all different types
        of candy like hard candy, choacalate, and sour candy. My favorite candy type is choacalate. I chose this topic because i love candy
        i have a very big sweet tooth so knowing this i wanted to do research and see what other people from other states like to have when they afre craving a sweet treat.</h3>
