            <section><h2>what is Ice cream?</h2>
            Ice cream is a very yummy frozen treat. It is made in many different flavors and so good 
            to have when it is hot outside to cool you down.Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically 
            made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an 
            alternative, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. It can be made by whisking a 
               flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth,
                foam that is solid at very low temperatures. It becomes more 
                malleable as its temperature increases, so you have to eat it fast so it dosent melt on your hand.
