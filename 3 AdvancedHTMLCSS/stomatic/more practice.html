            Ice cream is a very yummy frozen treat. it is made in many different flavors and so good 
            to have when it is hot outside to cool you down.Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically 
            made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an 
            alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries
             or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is
              cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and
               prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a 
               flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid
                foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more 
                malleable as its temperature increases.
